A/B Test Name: Photo Gallery Layout Test

User Story Number: US10

Metric (from the HEART grid): Engagement

Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that changing the layout of trip photo galleries from a grid layout to a timeline layout or vice versa will impact user engagement with the photo galleries. The problem we aim to solve is that users might find it cumbersome to navigate through trip photos in a grid layout, potentially leading to lower engagement and interaction with the app's photo sharing feature. By switching to a timeline layout, users may find it easier to follow the chronological narrative of their trip, potentially increasing engagement and satisfaction with the app.

Experiment:

- Audience: 50% of randomly selected users will be assigned to the control group, where they will continue to see trip photo galleries in the current timeline layout. The other 50% will be assigned to the experimental group, where they will see trip photo galleries presented in the new grid layout.
- Firebase Analytics Tracking: Set up event tracking to measure the following metrics:
  - Number of photo gallery views
  - Average time spent in photo galleries
  - Number of photos viewed per session
  - Time spent in the galleries screen
  - Time spent between opening consecutive photo gallerie
- Success Metrics: The success of the experiment will be determined based on an increase in the above-mentioned metrics in the experimental group compared to the control group.

Variations:

- Control Group: Trip photo galleries displayed in the existing timeline layout.-
- Experimental Group: Trip photo galleries displayed in a new grid layout with larger thumbnails and a responsive design to accommodate different screen sizes. (Provide mockups and design examples showcasing the new grid layout)
